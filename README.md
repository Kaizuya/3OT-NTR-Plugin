## How to Use This Plugin

### What you need
* A 3DS (n3DS, o3DS, or 2DS) system with CFW (custom firmware). If you do not have custom firmware and your system version is on 11.2.0-35 or lower, follow [Plailect's A9LH Guide](https://3ds.guide) to get CFW.
* A US/NA copy of Story of Seasons: Trio of Towns
* [BootNTR Selector](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-bootntr-selector.432911/).
* A CIA installer (such as FBI). If you follow Plailect's A9LH Guide, you will already have a CIA installer.
* The [latest version](https://github.com/KunoichiZ/3OT-NTR-Plugin/releases) of the plugins

1. Move one of the BootNTR Selector CIAs to your 3DS's SD card. You do not need to use either of the Mode 3 CIAs. It does not matter which CIA you choose to install. They all do the same thing.
2. Make a folder called plugin on the root of your SD card. 
3. Download the latest version of the plugin and extract it. 
4. In the latest version of the plugin, there should be a folder called 000400000019F500. Move that folder to your plugin folder.
5. Put your SD card back into your system and turn it on.
6. Install the BootNTR Selector CIA with FBI (or any CIA installer of your choice).
7. Launch BootNTR Selector after it is done installing and use the default settings.
8. Follow the instructions onscreen.
9. Re-open BootNTR Selector. For this plugin, it doesn't matter which version of NTR you choose (3.2, 3.3, or 3.4). Choose either one and you'll be booted back into the Home Menu.
10. Launch Story of Seasons: Trio of Towns. If you see a green flash when the Nintendo 3DS loading screen occurs, the plugin has been launched. Skip to Step 11. If you do not see a green flash, do the following:
* Turn off your 3DS. 
* Repeat steps 2-5. 
* Launch BootNTR Selector then once you get back to the Home Menu, launch Story of Seasons: Trio of Towns. Go to Step 11.
11. Open your save file. Once you see your character, press Select and enable the cheats you want with A. Press B to go back to your game.
12. ???
13. Profit!
